# CryptoClustering
### Challenge 19 of UoB Data Analytics bootcamp - Unsupervised Machine Learning

## 1. Overview
The main aim of this assignment was to use **unsupervised learning** to predict if cryptocurrences are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. Clusters were calculated on the original scaled data first. Then a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was run to reduce the number of features in the data, and clusters were calculated again. 

Clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction were run using the [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library for python. 


## 2. Repository, set up and execution
This repository contains:
- [`Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`](https://github.com/catisf/CryptoClustering/blob/main/Crypto_Clustering.ipynb): a jupyter notebook with all the necessary code to run the analyses. 
- [`Resources`](https://github.com/catisf/CryptoClustering/blob/main/README.md): folder containing the original data files used in the analyses. 

In order to run these analyses:
- Clone this repository into a local folder, by running `git clone https://github.com/catisf/CryptoClustering.git`.
- Open the `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` notebook and run the code.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to run these analyses, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, as well as relevant libraries (`pandas`, `hvplot` and `scikit-learn`)
