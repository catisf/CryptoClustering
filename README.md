# CryptoClustering
### Challenge 19 of UoB Data Analytics bootcamp - Unsupervised Machine Learning

## 1. Overview
The main aim of this assignment was to use **unsupervised learning** to predict if cryptocurrences are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. Clusters were calculated on the original scaled data first. Then a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was run to reduce the number of features in the data, and clusters were calculated again. 

Clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction were run using the [`scikit-learn` library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for python. 


## 2. Repository, set up and execution
This repository contains:
- [`Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`](): a jupyter notebook with all the necessary code to run the analyses. 
- [`Resources`](): folder containing the original data files used in the analyses. 

In order to run these analyses, you will need to have Python installed, as well as the relevant libraries (`pandas`, `hvplot` and `scikit-learn`). If you have all of these installed, just upen the jupyter notebook and run the code!
